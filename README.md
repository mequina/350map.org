## Setup

1. Make sure you have `node` and `npm` [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `npm install` to download all dependencies

## Build

1. For a one-time build, run `npm run build`
2. The JS files will be bundled into `bundle.js`
3. You need to run this command to update `bundle.js` before pushing new code to production

## Running the server

1. Run `npm start` and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
2. Webpack bundles the files once they are changed, so no need to restart the server to pickup new code!
